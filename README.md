Clustering Analysis with PCA and K-Means: 
Original and processed datasets is accessible in :Crypto_Clustering.ipynb

Project Overview:

This project performs clustering analysis on a dataset using K-Means clustering. By first applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality, we improve the accuracy and precision of the clustering results. The project demonstrates how reducing the number of features used for clustering can yield clearer, more meaningful groupings.
This analysis demonstrates the value of dimensionality reduction in clustering, allowing more accurate segmentation and insights. By focusing on key components, K-Means clustering becomes more effective in identifying distinct groups within the data.
